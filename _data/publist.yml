  description: We examine the structural characteristics of such patterns by optical microscopy. The analysis reveals that cell motility affects the formation of elongated crystals with lateral tips, as well as the creation of interlocked aggregates.

- title: "A strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in an iron-based superconductor"

  description: We succeeded in measuring the superfluid density with atomic resolution on an unconventional superconductor! In contrast to expectations for conventional superconductors, we find that the superfluid densisty is strongly inhomogeneous in FeTe0.55Se0.45.
