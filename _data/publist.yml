- title: "Experimental Study of Ordering of Hard Cubes by Shearing"
  image: shearing.png
  description: We experimentally analyze the compaction dynamics of an ensemble of cubic particles submitted to a novel type of excitation. Instead of the standard tapping procedure used in granular materials we apply alternative twists to the cylindrical container. Under this agitation, the development of shear forces among the different layers of cubes leads to particle alignment.

- title: "Lift on side by side intruders of various geometries within a granular flow"
  image: lift.png
  description: Here we present experimental results of the interaction between two side-by-side intruders of different shapes within a vertical granular flow. We built a quasi-two-dimensional container in which we placed the intruders and using load cells we measured lift and drag forces during the discharge process for different flow velocities.

  description: We examine the structural characteristics of such patterns by optical microscopy. The analysis reveals that cell motility affects the formation of elongated crystals with lateral tips, as well as the creation of interlocked aggregates.

  description:  We sought to understand why saline drops produce intriguing patterns when drying in the presence of zwitterionic liposomes. Specifically, we would like to comprehend why the nature of such patterns is hierarchically driven by the Hofmeister series.

  description: Here, results are presented on the effects of methylglyoxal on mycelium growth, stationary phase entry (monitored by autophagy induction), mitochondrial morphology and protein composition in the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum. Results Methylglyoxal leads to growth rate reduction of this fungus so that the entry into the stationary phase is delayed.
